# Company Intro Site (Astro)

A tiny, simple company introduction website built with Astro.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies

```bash
cd /opt/WB2/company-site
npm install
```

2. Run dev server (binds to 0.0.0.0)

```bash
npm run dev
```

The dev server will listen on 0.0.0.0; open `http://<host>:3000` (or the address shown in the terminal).

Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Notes

- The `dev` script uses `astro dev --host 0.0.0.0` so it is reachable from other machines on the network.
- If you don't have Node/npm installed, install Node 18+.
